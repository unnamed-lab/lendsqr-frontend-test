# Frontend Engineering Test for Lendsqr

## Assessment

Given the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/ZKILoCoIoy1IESdBpq3GNC/FrontendTesting?node-id=5530%3A0) which has sample pages to be built.

- Build the 4 pages: Login, Dashboard, User page, User details page
- The user pages should pull data from a mock api with 500 records
- Use local storage or indexedDB to store and retrieve user details on the user details page.
- The page must be mobile responsive
- Some details are intentionally left out of this instruction set. We feel the candidate should be able to spot and address them

## Tech stack

- NextJs (React Framework)
- TypeScript
- SCSS

## Mock API

Using the information provided on the Figma design, mock your APIs using common tools such as mocky.io or json-generator.com.

## What would be assessed

- Visual fidelity - your assessment must be picture and pixel perfect - it must be a 100% representation of the Figma design. As a frontend engineer, the quality of your render is sacrosanct
- Code quality - well structured and well written
- Application of best practice in design and architecture
- Unit testing - you must apply positive and negative scenario testing
- Quality of Github - your README docs, commit history and messages must be clear enough for a random engineer to understand what has been done and why
- Variable and function naming, conventions and consistency
- Semantic use of paths and resource naming
- Design responsiveness to media types

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
